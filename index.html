    <h2 id="background">Why Poverty Still Matters Today</h2>
    <p>
      Poverty isn’t just a number—it’s the everyday barrier that keeps people from finishing school,
      getting decent work, and accessing healthcare. It affects food on the table, time for learning,
      and the ability to recover from shocks like price spikes or disasters. In the Philippines, official
      statistics showed <strong>15.5% of Filipinos were living below the poverty line in 2023</strong>
      (Philippine Statistics Authority).
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond official counts, perception data helps us see how families feel their situation on the ground.
      In nationwide Social Weather Stations (SWS) surveys, many families continue to rate themselves as poor,
      with especially high levels in Visayas and Mindanao. The table below summarizes recent snapshots.

    <h2 id="current-efforts">What’s Being Done Right Now</h2>
    <p>
      The Philippine government’s flagship anti-poverty program, the
      <strong>Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps)</strong>, provides conditional cash transfers
      to low-income households to keep children in school and improve health and nutrition. It was
      institutionalized through <abbr title="Republic Act 11310">RA 11310</abbr>, recognizing it as a
      national poverty reduction strategy.
      <a href="https://pantawid.dswd.gov.ph/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source: DSWD</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond cash assistance, agencies and LGUs run livelihood, scholarship, feeding, and skills-training
      initiatives, while civil society groups support food security, community kitchens, and learning
      recovery programs. These efforts help—but gaps remain in access, scale, and sustainability,
      especially in rural and disaster-prone areas.

    <p>
      <strong>BridgeUp</strong> connects students, teachers, and community partners to turn data
      into action: we translate research into simple explainers, map local needs (food, learning, and
      livelihood), and organize school-to-community drives that are small, targeted, and trackable—
      so every peso and volunteer hour clearly counts.
