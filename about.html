    <p>
      <strong> BridgeUp</strong> was founded in 2025 by a group of hogh school studentswho saw how poverty 
      and lack of access to education were affecting children in their own communities. 
      The group began as a small volunteer effort in Davao City, where members organized weekend food drives 
      and tutorial sessions for children in public schools. The goal was simple: to create sustainable and 
      youth-led solutions that go beyond one-time charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, we realized that our strength lies in connecting research with action. By translating data 
      into community programs and making government statistics accessible to ordinary people, we help others 
      understand not just the “numbers” but the stories behind them. Today, BridgeUp works with local 
      schools, barangays, and NGOs to promote food security, learning recovery, and livelihood opportunities. 
      What started as a weekend initiative is now a growing youth-led advocacy network.

      We are a small but dedicated team of students who share the belief that change begins at the community level. 
      Each of us contributes in different ways—some focus on research and data gathering, others lead community 
      workshops, while others build networks with local leaders and organizations. Together, we aim to bridge the 
      gap between information and action so that families can access the resources and opportunities they need.
